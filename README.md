2D SLAM in cartographer with the current lidar is finished
New rosbag with imu data coming in, fixed the robot model so the direction is right, now the params need to be adjust so the right trajectory can be set
Existing problem;
rotation and translation is both odd, along with the pointcloud of Toposens is very few
